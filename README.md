# Conditional Image Generation with Score-Based Diffusion Models

This repository is an extension of the code base provided by Yang Song for the paper [Score-Based Generative Modeling through Stochastic Differential Equations](https://openreview.net/forum?id=PxTIG12RRHS). The code depends on pytorch and pytorch-lightning.

We have extended the code to support multi speed/sde diffusion. Multi speed diffusion opens the avenue for further research in conditional generation and hierarchical represenation learning using the score-based diffusion framework.

In this paper, we use multi speed diffusion to derive the CMDE and VS-CMDE estimators of conditional score. Those estimators are used for conditional image generation. We also provide the code for training conditional score models using the conditional denoising estimator (CDE).

Instructions: 

All the information for every experiment is stored in configurational python files. We used the ml_collections python library for constructing the configurational files.
Once you have re-written the relevant sections of the configuration file you can simply train or test the written configuration using the following command:

python -m main.py --mode train or test --config path_to_config

We have included all the configuration files for all the experiments presented in the paper:
All of the configuration files are under the folder: configs/ve/inverse_problems
